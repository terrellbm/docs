### Write good prompts

Reliability is still not great for computer-use agents. If you want better reliability, the best thing is to write **GOOD** prompts and **SPLIT** up your big prompts/tasks into smaller chunks

Good prompts generally have the following properties: 
  - **STOP** conditions (e.g., You should ALWAYS stop when you see the bottom of the page)
  - **INTERACTION** conditions (e.g., You should NEVER scroll up)
  - **RETURN** format/structure (e.g., Always return a JSON object with this structure 'example' : ['value1', 'value2'])

Here's an example of this prompting in action:
  ```python
  user_prompt = f"""
    # AGENT INSTRUCTIONS #
    You are currently on www.amazon.com

    Search for 'sponge cake plush'

    Click on the third product on the page

    Add the product to your cart

    # INTERACTION INSTRUCTIONS # 
    YOU SHOULD ONLY NEED TO SCROLL DOWN OR CLICK. NEVER DO ANYTHING ELSE
    WHEN YOU SCROLL DOWN, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS DO IT AT MOST ONCE ON A GIVEN PAGE  

    # ROADBLOCKS #
    If you encounter a CAPTCHA, you should ALWAYS ask the user to give you the answer to the CAPTCHA or take over [You likely need to take over on your VNC viewer until we add CAPTCHA support]

    # STOPPING CONDITION # 
    You are STRICTLY ONLY done until you have added the product to the cart 
    """
  ```

### Have a VNC viewer open as you developer
When building your agents with spongecake, we recommend having your VM pulled up in a VNC viewer so you can jump in and control the desktop if needed. See `Connecting to desktop` in the quickstart

### Concurrency
Think about what tasks can be done concurrently. E.g., can multiple agents work together to fill out a form? Or what if agent 1 performs actions on page 1, agent 2 performs actions on page 2, and so forth? We're working on making it easier to spin up agents concurrently
