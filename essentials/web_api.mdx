### API Endpoints

#### **`POST /api/action`**

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "type": "click",  // Action type (click, scroll, keypress, type, wait, screenshot)
  "x": 100,         // X coordinate (for click and scroll actions)
  "y": 200,         // Y coordinate (for click and scroll actions)
  "button": "left", // Button type for click (left, middle, right)
  "scroll_x": 0,    // Horizontal scroll amount
  "scroll_y": 10,   // Vertical scroll amount
  "keys": ["CTRL", "F"], // Keys to press (for keypress action)
  "text": "Hello World"  // Text to type (for type action)
}
```

**Response**:

- For screenshot action: `{"status": "success", "screenshot": "base64_encoded_image"}`

**Example Usage**:
```bash
# Click at coordinates (100, 200)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/action \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "click", "x": 100, "y": 200, "button": "left"}'

# Take a screenshot
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/action \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "screenshot"}'
```

> **⚠️ SECURITY WARNING**: The container's web server has no authentication or encryption by default. Anyone with network access to the API port can control the container. For security-sensitive applications or when running in production environments, you should:
> - Implement proper authentication if API access is required
> - Consider network isolation or firewall rules to restrict access

### Port Configuration

The API server runs on port 8000 by default. You can configure this using the `api_port` parameter when creating a Desktop instance:

```python
from spongecake import Desktop

# Create a desktop with custom API port
desktop = Desktop(api_port=8080)
desktop.start()
