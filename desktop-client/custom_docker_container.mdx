If you want to manually build and run the included Docker image for a virtual desktop environment you can follow these steps. To make your own changes to the docker container, fork the repository and edit however you need. This is perfect for adding dependencies specific to your workflows.

1. **Navigate to the Docker folder** (e.g., `cd spongecake/docker`).
2. **Build the image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t <name of your image> .
   ```
3. **Run the container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 5900:5900 --name <name of your container> <name of your image>
   ```
   - This starts a container that you name and exposes VNC on port **5900**.

4. **Shell into the container** (optional):
   ```bash
   docker exec -it <name of your container> bash
   ```
   This is useful for debugging, installing extra dependencies, etc.

5. You can then specify the name of your container / image when using the SDK
