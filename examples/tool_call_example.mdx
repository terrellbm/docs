description: A concise guide on using tool calling with Spongecake for targeted actions.
---

## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to utilize **tool calling** in Spongecake. Tool calling allows your agent to invoke custom functions directly from within the desktop container to enhance its capabilities and accuracy. This guide covers:

- Defining custom tools and function mappings.
- Using tools effectively with `desktop.action()`.
- Extending tool calling for various advanced workflows.

We'll demonstrate how to fetch targeted HTML content from a webpage, focusing on Wikipedia searches.

## Key Concepts

- **Defining Tools:** Tools are custom functions agents can invoke during their tasks to access specific data or perform targeted actions.
- **Function Map:** Links tool definitions to actual Python functions, allowing the agent to call them directly.
- **Agent Tool Calls:** Agents can request or return specific information dynamically during their execution, enhancing their effectiveness in targeted actions.

## Example: Fetching Wikipedia Content

This example shows how to define a custom tool for fetching specific HTML content from a Wikipedia page.

## Explanation

1. **Custom Tool Definition:**
   - Defined a custom tool (`get_wikipedia_elements`) specifically targeting Wikipedia page content.

2. **Function Map:**
   - Connected the defined tool to the corresponding Python function so the agent can invoke it.

3. **Agent Interaction:**
   - The agent autonomously calls the tool during its task to retrieve precise page content, avoiding unnecessary actions like scrolling.

## Extending Tool Calling

Tool calling in Spongecake is highly flexible and can be extended to:

- **Advanced Web Searching:** Dynamically fetch specific page sections to quickly answer questions.
- **Contextual Data Fetching:** Provide agents with relevant contextual data from your application during execution.
- **Interactive Automation:** Allow agents to trigger specific functions within your application, passing dynamic arguments based on runtime context.

Using tool calling significantly boosts your agent's efficiency, enabling more precise, powerful, and context-aware automations.
