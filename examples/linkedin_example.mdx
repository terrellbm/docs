### Notes on Prompting
- You can request responses in a specific JSON format.
- Keep agent reasoning simple‚Äîprovide clear context and examples to help decisions become automatic. This improves performance.
    - Example for returning LinkedIn prospects:
    ```
    ALWAYS return a marketing director if their title includes both 'Marketing' and 'Director' (in any order). Other words in the title are okay.
    ```
- On large pages (like Sales Navigator searches), scrolling can be challenging. Clearly instruct the agent how to scroll, e.g.:
    ```
    ALWAYS SCROLL DOWN. NEVER CLICK OR SCROLL UP.
    ```
- For broader tasks (e.g., "find the best sales leads"), include a clear stopping condition. For instance:
    ```
    You're ONLY finished when you see the pagination at the bottom (e.g., '1 2 3 4 5 6...'). NEVER CLICK ON THESE‚Äîonce visible, your task is complete.
    ```
