description: A concise guide on running multiple Spongecake containers concurrently.
---

## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to efficiently run multiple **Spongecake** desktop containers concurrently. It covers how to:

- Launch containers simultaneously.
- Collect and process results from concurrent tasks.
- Extend this pattern to various parallel workflows.

We'll use an example that checks the cheapest flights for multiple weekends in a given month, then identifies which weekend is the cheapest to fly.

## Key Concepts

- **Multiple Containers:** Each task runs in an isolated container with unique port assignments to prevent conflicts.
- **Parallel Execution:** Using Python's `ThreadPoolExecutor` for concurrency allows tasks to run simultaneously.
- **Aggregating Results:** Concurrent tasks return individual results that can be combined or analyzed further, such as finding the cheapest price.

## Example: Cheapest Weekend Flight

This example checks multiple weekends for the cheapest flights concurrently, aggregating the results to identify the lowest-priced weekend.

Click the destination field with a maps icon on the left hand side. Type in the destination location: {destination}, select the nearest airport. 
                Click on the departure field. A Calendar date-picker should open. Use the arrows on the left and ride hand side of the date picker container to find the given month: {month_map[month]}.

                Your task is to return the cheapest flight price for the given weekend of that month. You will need to find the cheapest flight for weekend number **{weekend_number}** in the month of {month_map[month]}. The dates of this weekend are {friday_date} - {sunday_date}.

                When selecting the weekend, you will see the days listed under the month as "S M T W Th F S" which represents the days of the week "Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday". All the dates that fall under "F" are the dates for Fridays of the month. All the dates that fall under the last "S" are the dates for Saturdays of the month. And all the dates that fall under the first "S" are dates for Sundays of the month.
                Click on the "Departure" field, then click the Friday date: {friday_date}. Then click the Sunday date: {sunday_date}.

                Once the dates are selected, ensure you are looking at the correct Friday - Sunday. If the wrong days are selected, click on the "Departure" field again to select the right days.
                Once it looks correct, click the blue "Done" button on the bottom right corner of the date picker. 

                Finally, click the "Search" button in the middle. This should load a new page with a list of flights. Return the first flight price from the list (omit the dollar sign when applicable) (e.g. 231) - and NO OTHER TEXT.

### Explanation

1. **Container per Weekend**  
   For each weekend number, we start a unique Spongecake container, specifying different ports. This prevents collisions and ensures each container is fully isolated.

2. **Aggregating Output**  
   Results from each weekend’s check are collected in the `results` dictionary. We also parse them to find the cheapest numeric value. This same pattern applies to any scenario where you combine or compare data returned by concurrent tasks.

3. **Isolation & Cleanup**  
   Each container is started and stopped independently. If one container fails, it doesn’t impact the other containers. You can build in better error handling using the handlers

---

## Extending This Pattern

- **Different Task Types**  
  Instead of fetching flight prices, each container could perform any custom action (e.g., scraping hotel info, running integration tests, or collecting data from multiple APIs).

- **Scaling**  
  You can spin up as many containers as needed, each using different ports or letting Spongecake handle port assignment. If you have many tasks, simply add them to the executor queue.

- **Aggregating Complex Data**  
  Here we simply pick a numeric minimum. In other scenarios, you might compile large datasets, compute averages, or merge JSON results. The concurrency pattern remains the same.

- **Robust Error Handling**  
  The example logs errors or invalid data. You can customize error-handling routines (e.g., retrials, fallback containers) depending on your reliability needs.
